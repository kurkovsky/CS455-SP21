/*
Reference variables vs pointer variables:
    * A pointer can be re-assigned while reference cannot, and must be assigned at initialization only.
    * Pointer can be assigned NULL directly, whereas reference cannot.
    * Pointers can iterate over an array, we can use ++ to go to the next item that a pointer is pointing to.
    * A pointer is a variable that holds a memory address. A reference has the same memory address as the item it references.
    * A pointer to a class/struct uses '->'(arrow operator) to access itâ€™s members whereas a reference uses a '.'(dot operator)
    * A pointer needs to be dereferenced with * to access the memory location it points to, whereas a reference can be used directly.
